# Shoyuuken Tanmatsu / 所有権端末 (SYK-TMT)

A terminal designed to eliminate opaque OS behaviors across multiple systems.  
Support for xarch emulation is planned. Learn more about [xarch: a modular computer architecture revised from the transistor level](https://github.com/kai5041/xarch) and [xwm: waiting for xarch](https://github.com/kai5041/xwm) for further details.

> Fun fact: SMT was born out of frustration when Kai/解 [(profile here)](https://github.com/kai5041) lost access to all his projects due to multiple failures of modern technology in a single day, January 9, 2026.  
> That catastrophic day forced him to create an enviroment that actually works.
